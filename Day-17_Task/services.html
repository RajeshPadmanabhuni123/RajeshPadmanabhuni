<h1>Hardware & Software</h1>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<pre>Be it laptops, workstations, printers, or servers, IT hardware systems are a key ingredient for every business. However, a breakdown or hardware loss could have a severe impact on the business’ revenue and ability to deliver to the market on time.

This is where IT hardware services come into play. These services help businesses keep their computers and other hardware assets running reliably and securely. In fact, even after retiring the device, the IT service provider will remove the hard drive to ensure that the business’ data and confidential information is not vulnerable.</pre>

<h2>Software</h2>
<pre>This primarily centers on software asset management (SAM). Under SAM, businesses work to ensure that their software licenses are up-to-date and compliant with end-user agreements.

In addition, the SAM service provider will look to reduce software costs by finding unused and redundant licenses. As an example, instead of buying a new license for a new employee, the SAM service provider will first check for existing unused licenses.</pre>

<h1>Network Infrastructure</h1>
<pre>A company’s network infrastructure would typically include its internet connectivity and internal networking between computers and other devices (such as printers).

When it comes to networks, the IT services provider’s main goal is to keep the network secure from internal and external threats. It typically does this by installing and managing firewalls for preventing malicious traffic from reaching the business.

It will also monitor the network to spot and react to abnormal traffic and intrusions. Businesses with remote-access, payment systems, and other specific network types will also need around-the-clock monitoring by an IT services provider.

In addition to network systems, your provider will also help with network policies. These could include preventing outside logins into the system (e.g., from other cities, states and countries), requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA), and other steps.</pre>

<h1>Mobile Device Management</h1>
<pre>Today, employees bringing their own phones to work and using them for work purposes is the norm. However, not every business has a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) program in place to secure their data and assets on these outside devices.

An IT services provider will help implement BYOD in your organization through mobile device management (MDM). This lets you to enforce security policies on your employees’ phones.

The benefit of MDM is that it ensures that only secure devices (e.g., unrooted phones) are able to access your data and applications. And in case of lost or stolen devices, MDM will allow you to remotely wipe data from those devices, thus keeping your data secure.</pre>

<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<pre>A growing number of businesses are relying on the cloud to host their data. In many cases, the data includes confidential information about clients, patients, and other assets.

IT services providers help businesses manage their cloud services in two ways.

First, they help with configuring and managing the cloud system. They will help with the complex work of setting up cloud hosted applications and data as well as resolve errors and downtime.

Second, they will keep your cloud systems secure from threats, such as intrusions. The idea — as with all other types of managed IT services — is to free you to focus on your core work and not get distracted by dealing with the day-to-day upkeep of your cloud assets.</pre>

<h1>Cyber Security</h1>
<pre>Finally, cyber security applies to each of the IT services above. However, it’s worth discussing on its own because it’s a complex and constantly evolving field.

IT service providers will keep abreast of these shifts and invest in the necessary technologies and skills to keep themselves and their clients secure. In turn, you don’t need to distract your team with keeping up with these issues; instead, you just have to focus on your core work.

Finally, in addition to support in managing your IT systems, IT service providers can also help with defining and implementing your future IT projects.

Their consultants will bring their proven experience to the table and help with roadmapping your future needs. They will help you save in terms of procurement and maintenance costs while also ensuring that you meet all of your requirements.</pre>
